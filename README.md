# Artifacts for Quartz

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```shell
pip install z3-solver
```

## Table 2: Evaluating the Quartz Generator and Verifier

Run the following script:

```shell
bash run_table2.sh
```

In the output of the script, lines starting with `***` indicate the numbers used in Table 2. We expect the numbers to
differ a little from the numbers in the submission due to floating-point errors.

## Characteristics and the Number of Transformations for the Three Gate Sets

Run the following script:

```shell
bash gen_ecc_set.sh
```

In the output, `*** ch(...) = ...` denotes the characteristics for each gate set.

`*** Number of transformations of ... = ...` denotes the number of transformations for each gate set. We expect the
numbers of transformations to differ a little from the numbers in the submission due to floating-point errors.

The generated ECC Sets are stored in Json files with file name formatted like
this: `{Gate set name}_{number of gates}_{number_of qubits}_complete_ECC_set.json`.

### The results of Qiskit

To reproduce the results of Qiskit on Nam's gate set, run the following script:

``` shell
python Qiskit_nam.py
```

The results will be shown in the console. The figure below shows part of the results as an example:

![](figures/Qiskit_nam_example.png)

As the figures shows, for each circuit, we run Qiskit with optimization 1, 2, 3, respectively. We choose the minimum gate count among the 3 optimization levels as the final result.

It is worth noting that optimizations in Qiskit involves some non-determinism, which means that the results may vary among different runs of the optimizations.

### The results of Nam

We refer the results of Nam on Nam's gate set to the paper "A verified optimizer for Quantum circuits" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434318). Specifically, the results can be found at Table 2, column "Nam(H)" in this paper.

### The results of VOQC

To reproduce the results of VOQC on Nam's gate set, run the following script:

``` shell
python VOQC_nam.py
```

The results will be shown in the console. The figure below shows part of the results as an example:

## Table 4: Comparing Quartz with existing circuit optimizers on the IBM gate set

### The results of Qiskit

To reproduce the results of Qiskit on IBMQ gate set, run the following script:

``` shell
python Qiskit_ibmq.py
```

The results will be shown in the console. The figure below shows part of the results as an example:

![](figures/Qiskit_ibmq_example.png)

As the figures shows, for each circuit, we run Qiskit with optimization 1, 2, 3, respectively. We choose the minimum gate count among the 3 optimization levels as the final result.

It is worth noting that optimizations in Qiskit involves some non-determinism, which means that the results may vary among different runs of the optimizations.

### The results of t|ket⟩

We refer the results of t|ket⟩ on IBMQ gate set to the paper "A verified optimizer for Quantum circuits" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434318). Specifically, the results can be found at Table 2, column "t|ket⟩" in this paper.

### The results of VOQC

To reproduce the results of VOQC on IBMQ gate set, run the following script:

``` shell
python VOQC_ibmq.py
```

The results will be shown in the console. The figure below shows part of the results as an example:

### The results of Quartz

## Table 5: Comparing Quartz with Quilc and t|ket⟩ on the Rigetti gate set (𝑅𝑥 (𝑘𝜋/2)(𝑘 ∈Z),𝑅𝑧(𝜆),𝐶𝑍)

### The results of Quilc

We use a docker image of Quilc (available at https://hub.docker.com/r/rigetti/quilc) for optimizing our quantum circuit benchmarks on the Quilc compiler. First, to get the latest stable version of Quilc, run `docker pull rigetti/quilc`. Second, start a Quilc server on a seperate process by running 
```shell
docker run --rm -it -p 5555:5555 rigetti/quilc -R
```
This spawn an RPCQ-mode Quilc server that Quilc's compiler can communication with over TCP. To reproduce the results of Quilc on Rigetti gate set, run the following script:

``` shell
python pyQuil_rigetti.py
```

The results will be shown in the console. The figure below shows part of the results as an example:

![](figures/pyquil_rigetti_example.png)

### The results of t|ket⟩

To reproduce the results of t|ket⟩ on Rigetti gate set, run the following script:

``` shell
python tket_rigetti.py
```

The results will be shown in the console. The figure below shows part of the results as an example:
